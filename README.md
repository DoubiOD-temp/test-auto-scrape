## 💻 Claude Code (CLI)

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal. It doesn't just suggest code; it executes routines, manages Git, and builds software alongside you.

### �️ Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** version 18 or newer.
- **Homebrew (Recommended for Mac):** To manage Node versions via `nvm`.

### 🚀 Installation

Open your terminal and run the following command to install Claude Code globally:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### ⌨️ Basic Usage

Once installed, simply type `claude` in any project directory to start the agent:

```bash
claude
```

**Common tasks you can ask Claude Code:**

- "Explain how this authentication flow works."
- "Refactor this component to use Tailwind CSS."
- "Write unit tests for the utility functions."
- "Find where the API error is originating from."
