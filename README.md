Claude Code is an agentic coding tool by Anthropic that functions as a full-fledged collaborator within your terminal. It goes beyond simple autocomplete by understanding your entire codebase, executing shell commands, editing files, and managing Git workflows through natural language. This tool is designed to live where developers work, providing deep integration with the command line to build software more efficiently.

To get started, you must have Node.js version 18.0.0 or later and a valid Anthropic API key with access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The CLI is installed globally using the command `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`. Once installed, you can verify the setup by running `claude --version` to ensure the tool is ready for use in your projects.

The tool operates through an interactive session started with the `claude` command, or via one-off tasks by passing a string argument like `claude "fix the login bug"`. Within the session, you can use slash commands such as `/config` to manage settings or `/permissions` to control how the agent interacts with your system. You can also reference specific files using the `@` symbol or execute direct shell commands by prefixing them with an exclamation mark.

Claude Code stands out due to its agentic reasoning and context awareness, utilizing "Extended Thinking" to solve complex architectural problems. It automatically indexes local files while respecting your `.gitignore` and can safely run tests or linting scripts to verify its own work. For larger projects, it can even spawn sub-agents to parallelize tasks across different parts of your system.

Security is managed through a tiered permission system that includes a default mode where Claude asks for approval, a read-only Plan Mode, and an Auto-Accept mode for low-risk changes. Safety features like reversible checkpoints and directory-limited sandboxing ensure that you remain in control of every file edit. This human-in-the-loop approach requires you to review every diff before changes are finalized on your system.

Configuration is handled through a hierarchical system, including a project-specific `CLAUDE.md` file for coding standards and global user settings in your home directory. Additionally, the tool supports the Model Context Protocol, allowing it to connect to external services like Jira, GitHub Issues, or Sentry. These integrations enable Claude to track progress, analyze production errors, and query database schemas directly from the terminal.

Common workflows involve bug hunting, where Claude can investigate API errors and apply fixes, or large-scale refactoring, such as converting class components to functional components. It is also highly effective for testing and quality assurance, as it can write Jest unit tests and execute them to ensure correctness. These capabilities make it a powerful resource for developers who prioritize staying within their terminal environment.
