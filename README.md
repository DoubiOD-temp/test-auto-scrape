Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn patterns and make decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. At its core, it relies on data — large sets of examples from which algorithms can learn general rules or relationships.

In traditional programming, humans write explicit instructions to map inputs to outputs. In ML, however, the system discovers those mappings automatically. For instance, a model trained on thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs can learn the subtle differences between them, later predicting which category a new image belongs to.

Machine learning can be divided into three main types:

- **Supervised learning**: the model learns from labeled data, such as past sales predicting future revenue.
- **Unsupervised learning**: the algorithm identifies hidden patterns or groups within unlabeled data, often used in clustering or anomaly detection.
- **Reinforcement learning**: the model learns through trial and error, receiving feedback through rewards or penalties — the same principle used in training game-playing AIs.

Applications are everywhere: recommendation systems suggest movies or products, speech recognition enables virtual assistants to understand commands, and predictive maintenance helps industries prevent costly equipment failures.

Ultimately, machine learning transforms data into practical intelligence, powering many of the tools that define modern technology.
